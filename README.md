Born in Sheffield, UK with a “lets try this and see what happens” sort of philosophy especially when it comes to problem solving. A believer in calm brings clarity much needed when my team and I capsized in a stormy Caribbean Sea, loosing equipment and were about to be washed into the shoreline rocks. Recently, I volunteered for a permaculture NGO in Zimbabwe as a media manager and project designer working with communities to set up projects towards capacity building and sustainability which is currently on hold as unfortunately it didn’t get funded before I ran out of money. 

Now, following my interests in tech and an unquenchable thirst for how things work, led me to code. As a fresh graduate and survivor of Makers Academy Remote code bootcamp, I’m now looking for a organisation to work for that I can add value to and learn from in the process.

## Skills

#### Programming through self-learning, un-learning and quick pick-up

My Makers Academy experience taught me that I am in control of my own learning, and don’t expect to be spoon-fed, always be aware of how and what you are learning and the importance of cementing understanding through practice and trial and error. 

Through Makers Academy I have had 12 weeks experience of regular  pair programming, stand-ups and weekly retro’s. Through this I have become a firm believer in regular reflection in an aim to improve learning and progress.

#### Effective communication

From writing countless History essays in my A-levels, my thesis at university, to travel blog posts for companies and teaching permaculture to communities in rural Zimbabwe, I have learnt that the crucial part of communication is your audience, and your aim should be universal understanding. 

- Volunteering in Zimbabwe I co-hosted small classes over 3-months to teach permaculture (and ethics based design system) to a group of local farmers, who had received poor education and to whom English wasn’t their first language. This taught me patience in explaining, and how to take complex ideas and work them into ways that help people understand. The attendees of the class are now working on their own projects based on what they learnt.
- I also co-wrote Grant applications and a successful crowdfunding campaign for the NGO.

- Travel blog post for  [Trakke bags](http://trakke.co.uk/in-the-wild-zimbabwe/)

- A video I filmed and edited for [PORET’s education Project](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XKM-Yy9I9mw)

- The website I designed created media for and wrote blogs prior to Makers Academy using Squarespace: [PORET Livelihoods](http://www.poret-livelihoods.com)
